## About the Project

Lane detection is a critical component of autonomous driving systems and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS). This project provides a simple yet effective implementation of lane detection using OpenCV and Flask. It includes:

- **Backend API**: Processes images and videos to detect lanes.
- **Frontend Interface**: Allows users to upload images/videos and view the results.

---

## Features

- **Image and Video Support**: Detect lanes in both images and videos.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Process video streams in real-time.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Upload files and view results through a web interface.
- **Customizable**: Easily extend the project for advanced use cases.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sainikithavantari/lanedetection.git
   cd lanedetection
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the backend server**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Open the frontend**:
   - Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

## Usage

### Backend API

The backend API provides two endpoints:

1. **Process Image**:
   - Endpoint: `/process-image`
   - Method: `POST`
   - Input: Upload an image file.
   - Output: Returns the processed image with detected lanes.

2. **Process Video**:
   - Endpoint: `/process-video`
   - Method: `POST`
   - Input: Upload a video file.
   - Output: Returns the processed video with detected lanes.

### Frontend Interface

1. **Upload an Image**:
   - Click the "Upload Image" button.
   - Select an image file (e.g., JPG, PNG).
   - View the input and output images.

2. **Upload a Video**:
   - Click the "Upload Video" button.
   - Select a video file (e.g., MP4, AVI).
   - View the input and output videos.
